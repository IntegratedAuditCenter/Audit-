# Integrated Audit Center Website

This package contains the bilingual website (Arabic and English) for the Integrated Audit Center, including the logo image.

## Files Included

- `index.html` — Arabic version of the website.
- `index_en.html` — English version of the website.
- `شعار المركز.png` — Official logo image used in both pages.

## Instructions for Use

1. Upload all files (HTML + PNG) to the root directory of your web hosting (e.g., via cPanel, FTP, or File Manager).
2. Make sure the logo file keeps the exact name: `شعار المركز.png`.
3. When you open `index.html`, you’ll see the Arabic version with a button to switch to English (`index_en.html`), and vice versa.
4. No backend is required — this is a static HTML website and works on any server.

## Optional

- You can rename `شعار المركز.png` if needed, but make sure to update the `<img src="...">` path in both HTML files accordingly.
- To enhance performance, you may consider compressing the PNG image or hosting it via CDN.
